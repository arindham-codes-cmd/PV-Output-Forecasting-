Solar Power Generation Data

This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

the dataset files are something like this
Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv , Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv
Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv , Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv

Columns of plant 1 generation data
DATE_TIME	
PLANT_ID	
SOURCE_KEY	
DC_POWER 	
AC_POWER	 
DAILY_YIELD	
TOTAL_YIELD

columns of plant 1 weather data
DATE_TIME	
PLANT_ID	
SOURCE_KEY	
AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE	
MODULE_TEMPERATURE	
IRRADIATION

Similarly we have plant 2 generation and weather data.
